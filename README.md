# Customer Churn Prediction for the Telecom Industry  

## 📋 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers likely to leave their services, enabling proactive retention strategies.  

## 💡 Key Features  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed detailed visualizations and statistical analyses to understand churn patterns.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features and selected the most impactful ones.  
- **Model Building:** Implemented machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, SupportVectorMachine, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Deployment (if applicable):** Deployed the model using Flask.
